# Windows Dev Box Setup Scripts

This repo was originally forked from [Microsoft's Windows Dev Box Setup Scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts).

The Microsoft repo appears to have stalled. For simplicity, I've ruthlessly deleted any unused scripts in this repo. Do go and browse the examples in the [parent repo](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts).


## How to run the scripts

- Before you begin, please read the [Legal](#Legal) section.
- __Study__ and understand any script that you run
- Consider forking this repo and creating your own recipes

### Install Boxstarter Shell

1. Open an administrative powershell window 
1. Enter in a single line. (Ref: [Boxstarter Docs](https://boxstarter.org/installboxstarter#installing-from-the-web) )
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://boxstarter.org/bootstrapper.ps1')); Get-Boxstarter -Force
    ```
### Run Scripts from the BoxStarter Shell

1. Open Boxstarter shell (From the desktop shortcut)
1. Configure credentials to enable auto reboot
